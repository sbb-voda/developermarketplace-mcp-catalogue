Introduction to the Lab ðŸ§ª
This workspace enables developers to trial APIs, provide feedback and collaborate with Vodafone teams to prioritise the release of new products to market.
This workspace serves as an additional resource to the Vodafone Developer Marketplace.

Getting started ðŸ”¬
Product collections
The collections in this workspace contain pre-prepared examples of experimental APIs currently available in the Vodafone Developer sandbox or mocking service. The collections will help you quickly execute the APIs in a test environment and accelerate your development. We would love to get feedback on your applications and use cases for these APIs, along with any suggestions for improvements. You can reach us using our developer feedback form.
To get started, click on the product folder in the collections tab for more details on the specifications that the APIs follow, market coverage, and steps to secure a connection and call the API resource.
Where appropriate, both positive and negative cases have been included in the collection responses. You can fork the collection to your own workspace or view as read-only in the Vodafone workspace.
To use the collections, you first need to create a set of sandbox credentials on the Vodafone Developer Marketplace portal. Once created, add the key and secret to the relating "Lab Credentials" environment variable. More detail on the security model applied to each API is provided in the overview document saved against each product folder in the collections tab.
